==============
To build a web scraping pipeline that supports the Catholic AI models, you will need to implement robust data extraction from various sources (websites, documents, etc.), clean and structure the data, and provide it for use by AI models. Below is an example Python code using popular libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Requests to scrape structured and unstructured data and store it in a PostgreSQL database for further use.
Web Scraping with Python

    Install Necessary Libraries: First, you'll need to install some libraries to handle web scraping and data storage.

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 scrapy psycopg2 pandas

Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: Here's a sample script that extracts data from a Catholic website, parses the HTML, and extracts useful content.

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import psycopg2
    from datetime import datetime
    import json

    # Define PostgreSQL connection parameters
    DB_PARAMS = {
        'host': 'localhost',  # your database host
        'database': 'catholic_data',  # your database name
        'user': 'username',  # your username
        'password': 'password'  # your password
    }

    # Example website URL (replace with a relevant Catholic website)
    WEBSITE_URL = "https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html"  # Vatican website example

    def fetch_and_parse(url):
        """
        Fetches and parses the HTML content from the given URL.
        """
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Check if request was successful
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
            return soup
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
            return None

    def extract_data(soup):
        """
        Extracts relevant data from the HTML page.
        Example: Extract titles, paragraphs, etc.
        """
        if soup:
            title = soup.find('title').text.strip()  # Extract the page title
            paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')  # Extract all paragraphs

            paragraph_texts = []
            for para in paragraphs:
                paragraph_texts.append(para.text.strip())

            # Example of extracting additional metadata (this can be expanded)
            extracted_data = {
                'title': title,
                'content': ' '.join(paragraph_texts),
                'url': WEBSITE_URL,
                'scraped_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
            }

            return extracted_data
        return None

    def save_to_database(data):
        """
        Saves the extracted data to the PostgreSQL database.
        """
        try:
            conn = psycopg2.connect(**DB_PARAMS)
            cursor = conn.cursor()

            # Insert extracted data into the database
            cursor.execute("""
                INSERT INTO catholic_scraping_data (title, content, url, scraped_at)
                VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)
            """, (data['title'], data['content'], data['url'], data['scraped_at']))

            conn.commit()
            cursor.close()
            conn.close()
            print("Data saved to database")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error saving data to database: {e}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        soup = fetch_and_parse(WEBSITE_URL)
        if soup:
            data = extract_data(soup)
            if data:
                save_to_database(data)

Breakdown of the Python Code:

    Fetch HTML Content: The function fetch_and_parse(url) sends a GET request to the specified URL, retrieves the HTML content, and uses BeautifulSoup to parse it.

    Extract Data: In extract_data(soup), we extract relevant content from the page. This is where you can customize how the data is gathered, depending on the structure of the website you are scraping. For example, we are extracting the page's title and all the paragraphs of the page.

    Save Data: The save_to_database(data) function connects to a PostgreSQL database and inserts the scraped data into a table. Ensure that the database and table exist beforehand.

Database Schema:

Here’s an example schema for storing the data:

CREATE TABLE catholic_scraping_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    url TEXT,
    scraped_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

Scheduled Scraping

To automate the process of scraping on a regular basis (e.g., daily or weekly), you can set up a cron job or use Celery with Django or Flask to schedule recurring jobs.

For example, using Python's schedule library, you can set up a job:

pip install schedule

import schedule
import time

def scheduled_job():
    print("Starting scheduled scrape...")
    soup = fetch_and_parse(WEBSITE_URL)
    if soup:
        data = extract_data(soup)
        if data:
            save_to_database(data)

# Schedule to run every day at 7 AM
schedule.every().day.at("07:00").do(scheduled_job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute before checking again

Error Handling and Logging

To ensure reliability and monitor the scraping jobs, use logging:

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def fetch_and_parse(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        logger.info(f"Successfully fetched {url}")
        return BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
        return None

Improvements for Better Data Management

    Handling PDF Files: If you need to scrape PDF documents (e.g., Church documents or historical texts), use libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfminer.six to extract content from PDFs.

    Using Selenium or Playwright: If you're scraping dynamic content (e.g., JavaScript-rendered pages), use Selenium or Playwright to render JavaScript and extract the content.

    Data Validation: Ensure that the extracted data is consistent and valid by using regular expressions or predefined data patterns.

    NLP and AI Integration: After extracting the data, consider applying NLP techniques to clean and process the text (e.g., tokenization, named entity recognition) to improve data quality for AI/ML models.

Conclusion

This Python code provides the foundation for building a recurring web scraping pipeline to extract structured and unstructured data from Catholic-related websites. It connects to a PostgreSQL database to store the data, ensuring scalability and long-term usability. You can build on this foundation to scrape multiple websites, handle more complex data formats, and enhance the scraping process with additional features like error handling, scheduling, and NLP integration
